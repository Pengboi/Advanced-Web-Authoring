## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
The module followed two tasks namely the TMA (25% weighting) and FMA (75% weighting). Both followed client scenarios where we were debriefed on a business clients' needs and asked to produce deliverables satisfying identified requirements. 

The TMA featured a client requesting a single-page website for their clothing company - where the client had already established mockup designs and wanted a mobile-first responsive website. My final submission attained a mark of 87/100 - feedback included in TMA folder.

The FMA featured a client requesting designs for a business website reflective of their prestigious, rare-books brand. In this scenario, we were asked to produce mockup deliverables in addition to the final product which invoked more creative freedoms for the final submission. Similar to the TMA, the website was expected to be responsive and cross-browser compliant. My final submission attained a mark of 86/100 - feedback included in FMA folder.
